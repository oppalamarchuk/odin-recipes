    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Avgolemono is a rich, silky, and comforting Greek soup made with chicken broth and Arborio rice, enriched
        with beaten eggs and lemon juice, that's amazingly delicious!
        I've made this epic Greek soup many times but this recipe is made from scratch with a whole chicken and homemade broth.
        Garnish with parsley and lemon zest.

    <ul> Ingredients:
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 ribs celery, chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, chopped</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano leaves</li>
        <li>3 quarts cold water</li>
        <li>2 cups finely diced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2/3 cup arborio rice, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Â½ cup fresh lemon juice or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <ol> Steps:
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place chicken, 1 chopped onion, celery, carrot, bay leaves, salt, and oregano in a large pot. Pour water over the top; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, skimming foam as necessary, until chicken is falling off the bone, 60 to 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

        </li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a large bowl to cool. Strain all vegetables from simmering broth, discard vegetables, and return broth to the pot.</li>

        <li>Chop chicken meat into bite-sized pieces and set aside.

        </li>
        <li>Combine 2 cups diced onion, olive oil, and a pinch of salt in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion mixture until onion is soft, sweet, and golden, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir onion mixture into broth in the pot and set over medium-low heat; add Arborio rice and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until rice is very tender and broth flavors combine, about 45 minutes.</li>

        <li>Whisk together eggs, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a medium bowl; whisk in lemon juice until combined. Slowly pour 1 cup broth mixture into egg mixture, whisking constantly.</li>
        <li>Whisk another 1 cup broth mixture into egg mixture, then pour egg mixture into the pot. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Add chopped chicken and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
